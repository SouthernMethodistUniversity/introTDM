    "* Whatâ€™s an API?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"An API, or Application Programming Interface, is, in general, a defined way for different parts of software systems to talk to each other. A software system is made of many individual parts that must work together to respond to commands or requests. When humans need to talk to each other, we try to use a language that all parties involved can understand, and that language has rules and guidelines that govern how we form words and sentences with particular meanings. Similarly, APIs are built with rules that must be followed for successful interactions.\" [Getting Data for Digital Humanities with APIs: A Gentle Introduction](https://studentwork.prattsi.org/dh/2019/05/13/getting-data-for-digital-humanities-with-apis/)\n",

    "* GitHub is a web-based interface that uses Git (open source version control software that lets multiple people make separate changes to web pages at the same time). It allows for version control for files used in collaborative projects, such as workshops. \n",

    "* \"Web scraping, web harvesting, or web data extraction is data scraping used for extracting data from websites. While web scraping can be done manually by a software user, the term typically refers to automated processes implemented using a bot or web crawler. It is a form of copying in which specific data is gathered and copied from the web, typically into a central local database or spreadsheet, for later retrieval or analysis.\" [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping)\n",
