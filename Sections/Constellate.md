# JSTOR Constellate

* [Quickstart](https://constellate.org/news/user-quick-start)

* [What is Constellate?](https://constellate.org/docs/what-is-constellate/)[Constellate](https://labs.jstor.org/projects/text-mining/) is text analytics platform from ITHAKA with three goals:  learning, building and analyzing.

**SMU has a trial to Constellate’s full research and pedagogy features for the Spring 2022 semester.** 
  
  * *teach and learn* text analytics
    * [Constellate tutorials](https://constellate.org/tutorials/)
  
  * *build datasets* from across multiple content sources
     * Two of ITHAKA’s services, JSTOR and Portico, are the initial sources of content for the new platform, which includes: [Chronicling America, collections from Documenting the American South, the South Asia Open Archives and Independent Voices from Reveal Digital.](https://constellate.org/docs/data-sources/)  
    * [Build a new dataset](https://constellate.org/builder/)  
    * [Dataset Dashboard and Example datasets](https://constellate.org/dataset/dashboard/)
    * [Working with Dataset Files](https://constellate.org/tutorials/working-with-dataset-files)
    * examples available when logged in 
  
   * *visualize and analyze* their datasets.

## Login (Twice!)   
* 1st: [Login into JSTOR through your institution: SMU](https://login.proxy.libraries.smu.edu/login?url=https://www.jstor.org/). 
This is what it looks like when you have logged into JSTOR through SMU:

* 2nd: Login into *your* personal JSTOR account. [This option will appear after you logon to JSTOR](https://www-jstor-org.proxy.libraries.smu.edu/action/showLogin?redirectUri=/)  
* *Note: Choose the Google log on option.*

* If you don't have a google account [you can create one here.](https://accounts.google.com/signup/v2/webcreateaccount?hl=en&flowName=GlifWebSignIn&flowEntry=SignUp) You can choose a new gmail address for your account or you can choose to use an existing email (such as your smu.edu email).

* Now go to [Constellate](https://constellate.org/)

* This is what it looks like when you are logged into JSTOR and Constellate. Note how you are logged into the SMU account and your JSTOR account.[![logged into JSTOR and Constellate](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/introTDM/blob/main/images/loginconstellate.PNG)](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/introTDM/blob/main/images/loginconstellate.PNG)

* Enter your keywords in *Build your dataset* and search. It will then run your search. You can use filters to refine and modify your search.
[![Build](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/introTDM/blob/main/images/buildconstellate.PNG)](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/introTDM/blob/main/images/buildconstellate.PNG)

* Once your results look interesting to you, click on *Build* your dataset. It will ask if you want to name your dataset.

* You will then be at your *Dataset Dashboard* which displays recently viewed datasets and example datasets.
[![dataset dashboard](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/introTDM/blob/main/images/buildconstellate3.PNG)](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/introTDM/blob/main/images/buildconstellate3.PNG)

* Scroll down to see the example datasets.

* **The options available to you are:** 
* Analyze: This will allow you to analyze your dataset in the Constellate Lab by opening any of the tutorial Jupyter Notebooks (in the Python programming language) as seen below.
