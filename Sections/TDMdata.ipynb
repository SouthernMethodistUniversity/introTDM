    "  * A *dataset* is a structured collection of data generally associated with a unique body of work.\n",
    "  * A *database* is an organized collection of data stored as multiple datasets. Those datasets are generally stored and accessed electronically from a computer system that allows the data to be easily accessed, manipulated, and updated. \n",

    "\n",
    "For the purposes of completing a project in a semester, we recommend choosing an already existing 'good' data set so that you can start [your analysis.](https://www.usgs.gov/data-management/analyze)\n",
    "\n",
    "* What do we mean by a 'good' data set? \n",
    "\n",
    "The considerations you should keep in mind for [creating a data set,](https://researchdata.ox.ac.uk/home/managing-your-data-at-oxford/organising-your-data/) are the same things you want to look for when searching for a dataset for research. \n",
    "    \n",
    "   * Is there a [Data dictionary](https://www.usgs.gov/data-management/data-dictionaries) or any kind of documentation that states how the date was derived and why it was recording in the way it was. \n",
    "    \n",
    "   * Good documentation makes material *understandable, verifiable, and reusable* (by you or by others).\n",
    "    \n",
    "   * What are the file naming conventions? \n",
    "    \n",
    "   * Is there metadata ?\n",
    "       * Metadata is simply ‘data about data’.  It is related to the broader contextual information that describes your data, but is usually more structured in that it conforms to set standards and is machine readable.  One typical use of metadata is to create a catalogue record for a dataset held in an archive. By using a standard set of tags, an automatic system can tell where the information about the title, creator, description and so forth begin and end.\n",
    "    \n",
    "   * Data that is not structured or cleaned is referred to as unstructured, noisy or dirty. *A messy data set can be used but you will need to spend time [processing that data:](https://www.usgs.gov/data-management/process) either cleaning, structuring and/or organizing it.* \n"
