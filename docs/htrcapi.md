# HTRC API

* [HathiTrust Digital Library](https://www.hathitrust.org/digital_library)
* [HathiTrust Research Center](https://analytics.hathitrust.org/)
    * The HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) enables computational analysis of the HathiTrust corpus.
    * Log in with your partner institution (SMU) account to access the largest number of volumes and features.

##  HTRC for Text Analysis
* [HTRC Algorithms](https://analytics.hathitrust.org/statisticalalgorithms) are web-based, click-and-run tools to perform computational text analysis on volumes in the HathiTrust Digital Library.

* In a basic text analysis workflow, a researcher:
    * Gathers digitized text (text that has been scanned and OCR-ed) Note: OCR (Optical character recognition) refers to the mechanical or electronic conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text. 
     * Applies computational methods to that text, such as word counts, classification techniques, and topic modeling
    * And then analyzes the results generated by the algorithm or technique

* HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) enters the workflow *at the points of providing digitized text at scale* from HathiTrust Digital Library (HTDL) and providing tools and services that enable computational research. 
* The researcher, of course, still brings her own analysis to bear on the results.


## API (application programming interface)

An application programming interface (API) is a way for two or more computer programs or components to communicate with each other.


Additional Explanation form technology companies: 
- Postman: [video explanation of API](https://youtu.be/-0MmWEYR2a8?si=ilGP5D2w71AEdZHh), [Text explanation of API](https://www.postman.com/what-is-an-api/)
- IBM: [text explanation of API](https://www.ibm.com/topics/api)


Example APIs: loc.gov
- For example, look at these pages from the Library of Congress
- The [main page](https://www.loc.gov/) is meant for people to interact with. 
- The [APIs for LoC.gov](https://www.loc.gov/apis/) "makes information available via a series of application programming interfaces (APIs)" it is meant to retrieve information from Loc.gov in a way that is formatted for a machine and for a programming interface.

### HTRC Extracted Features (EF) API

The HTRC Extracted Features Dataset v.2.0 is composed of page-level features for 17.1 million volumes in the HathiTrust Digital Library. This version contains non-consumptive features for both public-domain and in-copyright books.
Features include part-of-speech tagged term token counts, header/footer identification, marginal character counts, and much more.

* A full explanation of the dataset's features, motivation, and creation is available at the EF Dataset documentation page: [HTRC Extracted Features (EF) Documentation](https://htrc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/COM/pages/43295914/Extracted+Features+v.2.0/)
