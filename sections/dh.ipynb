Since many text analysis methods rely on statistical models, it is generally true that having more texts will improve the outcomes of your analysis. It is also generally true that an ideal set of texts—or corpus—will be:\n","\n","* Full-text\n","* Easily readable, such as plaintext files or Python strings\n","\n","In practice, \"easily-readable\" means that you could hypothetically copy and paste the text. It is common, however, when doing text analysis to work with current works which are in copyright. If it is not possible to access \"full-text\" due to applicable copyright laws, the ideal corpus will give readers access to [n-gram](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#n-gram) counts. In the cases where Constellate cannot supply full-text due to copyright laws (JSTOR and Portico content), we supply three n-gram counts:\n","\n","* Unigrams- A single-word construction, for example: \"vegetable\".\n","* Bigrams- An two-word construction, for example: \"vegetable stock\".\n","* Trigrams- A three-word construction, for example: \"homemade vegetable stock\".\n","\n","While having the full texts for the documents in your corpus is ideal, a great deal can be still be discovered through the use of unigrams. Even when researchers have access to the full-texts of a corpus, it is common for them to create a list of n-gram counts for analysis. \n","___\n","<font color=\"red\">Read more</font>\n","* [Constellate Dataset Builder: full-text and n-gram content](https://constellate.org/docs/data-sources)\n","* [Bring your own data into Constellate](https://constellate.org/docs/import-data-into-constellate)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"a3cea84c","metadata":{},"source":["## I have my own data.

A word cloud visualizes the most frequent content words in a text or corpus. Before you can create a word cloud, however, you need to collect the word frequencies for all the words in your text. You may also need to use a [stop words list](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#stop-words) to remove common [function words](https://docs.constellate.org/key-terms/#function-words) (grammatical word constructions like \"the\", \"of\", and \"or\").\n","\n","<font color=\"red\">Start learning</font> [Word Frequency Analysis](./exploring-word-frequencies.ipynb) and create a word cloud\n","___\n","\n","**Significant Terms** (Beginner Friendly)\n","\n","Search engines use significant terms analysis to match a user query with a list of appropriate documents. This method could be useful if you want to search your corpus for the most significant texts based on a word (or set of words). It can also be useful in reverse. For a given document, you could create a list of the ten most significant terms.

We might see something like:\n","\n","* Topic 1: baseball, ball, player, trade, score, win, defeat\n","* Topic 2: market, dow, bull, trade, run, fund, stock\n","* Topic 3: campaign, democratic, polls, red, vote, defeat, state\n","\n","We can recognize that these words tend to cluster together within newspaper sections such as \"Sports\", \"Finance\", and \"Politics\". If we have never read a set of documents, we might use a topic analysis to get a sense of what topics are in a given corpus. Given that Topic Analysis is an exploratory technique, it may require some expertise to fine-tune and get good results for a given corpus.

A concordance gives the context of a given word or phrase in a body of texts. For example, a literary scholar might ask: how often and in what context does Shakespeare use the phrase \"honest Iago\" in Othello? A historian might examine a particular politician's speeches, looking for exmaples of a particular \"dog whistle\".\n","\n","<font color=\"red\">Read more</font>\n","\n","* Steven E.
