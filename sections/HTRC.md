# Worksets
* [Recommended Worksets](https://analytics.hathitrust.org/staticrecommendedworksets) are curated worksets created by real researchers of projects that utilize resources from the HathiTrust Digital Library and can be analyzed with tools built by the HTRC.

##  Algorithms
* [HTRC Algorithms](https://analytics.hathitrust.org/statisticalalgorithms) are web-based, click-and-run tools to perform computational text analysis on volumes in the HathiTrust Digital Library. 

[![HTRC for text analysis](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/introTDM/blob/main/images/htrcta.png)](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/introTDM/blob/main/images/htrcta.png)

* In a basic text analysis workflow, a researcher:
    * Gathers digitized text (text that has been scanned and OCR-ed) Note: OCR (Optical character recognition) refers to the mechanical or electronic conversion of images of typed, handwritten or printed text into machine-encoded text. 
     * Applies computational methods to that text, such as word counts, classification techniques, and topic modeling
    * And then analyzes the results generated by the algorithm or technique

* HathiTrust Research Center (HTRC) enters the workflow *at the points of providing digitized text at scale* from HathiTrust Digital Library (HTDL) and providing tools and services that enable computational research. 
* The researcher, of course, still brings her own analysis to bear on the results.


# TDM tools 
* For performing text analysis, there are both pre-built tools and do-it-yourself tools that you can choose from. 

## Pre-built
* The benefits of pre-built tools are they are usually easy to use, they don’t require too much technical knowledge, and they can be very useful in teaching.

* The main drawback of pre-built tools is because they have predefined functions, they offer less control to the researcher and limit what a user can accomplish.

* [Voyant](https://voyant-tools.org/), [Lexos](https://wheatoncollege.edu/academics/special-projects-initiatives/lexomics/lexos-installers/), and [HTRC algorithms](https://analytics.hathitrust.org/algorithms) are examples of pre-built tools. The HTRC Topic Modeling algorithm, which identifies “topics” in a set of text based on words that have a high probability of occurring close together, is a representative HTRC algorithm that can be used for exploratory analysis. 

* Choosing a pre-built tool is based on the goal of the analysis. Each pre-built tool has its own strengths, outputs, and weaknesses. 
* For quick analysis and visualizations, Voyant and Lexos are all excellent choices. They don’t allow much parameterization, but they are very easy to use. To make concordances(seeing key words in context), AntConc or Voyant are tools programmed to do that. Voyant is both web-based and downloadable, so there no installation required unless desired by the researcher, while AntConc is software the user must install on their computer.
* [Weka](https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/) is the tool to use for researchers who want to try machine learning with a tool that has a visual front-end. It also needs to be installed.

### HTRC tools
* Use the HTRC algorithms as an example of how to use a pre-built tool for text analysis. The HTRC provides some algorithms through HTRC Analytics, and they can be used to analyze HTRC worksets.
* An algorithm is just a way of saying a computer function - text goes in, process happens, and results come out. 
* HTRC algorithms can extract, refine, analyze, and visualize worksets. They can basically perform “plug-and-play” text analysis. 
* Because they are built into HTRC Analytics, they are mostly limited in how much they can be tweaked or customized. The algorithms are primarily for users who don’t know how or don’t want to work with custom code. It can be a good tool for learning and just trying things out. 
* How do you choose which HTRC algorithm to use? Naturally, it depends on what you want to do. 
* Some of the algorithms are task oriented. For example, there are ones for running spellcheck reports, for creating word counts, for visualizing more frequently used words, and for generating a list of named entities. 
* Others algorithms are more analytic, like one that generates topic models, and another that compares salient words in two worksets.

#### Topic Modeling
* An example of specific text analysis method is *topic modeling.* One concept closely related to topic modeling is the bag-of-words model. 
    * “Bag-of-words” is a concept where grammar and word order of the original text are disregarded and frequency is maintained. Here is an example of the beginning of The Gettysburg Address as a bag of words.
    [![Bag of Words](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/introTDM/blob/main/images/bagwords.png)](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/introTDM/blob/main/images/bagwords.png)
* Topic modeling is a method of using statistical models for discovering the abstract "topics" that occur in a collection of documents.
 [![topic model](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/introTDM/blob/main/images/topicmodel.png)](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/introTDM/blob/main/images/topicmodel.png)
* For this kind of analysis, the text is chunked, and stop words (frequently used words such as “the”, “and”, “if”) are removed since they reveal little about the substance of a text. 
* The computer treats the textual documents as bags of words, and guesses which words make up a “topic” based on their proximity to one another in the documents, with the idea the words that frequently co-occur are likely about the same thing. 
* So the different colored groupings are the groups of words that the computer has statistically analyzed and determined are likely related to each other about a “topic”.

* Here are some tips for topic modeling:
    * Treat topic modeling as one part of a larger analysis.
    * Understand what you input, including how you set your parameters, will affect the output. Some points to note are:
    * Be careful with how you set the number of texts analyzed, as well as number of topics generated
    * Be familiar with your input data
    * Know that changing your stop word list can have really interesting impacts on your topics, so tread carefully/wisely.
    * You’re going to want to go back to the text at some point. Make sure to examine your results to see if they make sense.
    * Also, try to gain some basic understanding of your tool. **Reading some relevant documentation is especially important when the tool is within a “black box”.** Speaking of understanding your tools, it’s important to note that the HTRC algorithm only has two parameters you can set right now, so it’s not suitable for really robust topic modeling. But for teaching and exploration of HT text specifically, the HTRC topic modeling algorithm can be a good place to start.
