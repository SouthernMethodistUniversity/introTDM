# Session 1: Introduction to Text and Data Mining (TDM)

## What goes into learning how to do a text mining project?
* This session will consist of an overview of the fundamental text analysis methods common in digital humanities and digital scholarship.  

Goals: 
* Introduce text analysis and broad text analysis workflows
*  Make sense of digital scholarly research practices
    * This session will help anyone who is interested in text analysis but unsure what methods might help their current research project.

    * This is the **first session** in a sequence of scaffolded workshops that are meant to culminate in you being able to completing a text mining project. 
        * What research questions can be answered with Text Mining?

# Session 2: Introduction to finding datasets for Text and Data Mining (TDM)

## What goes into learning how to do a text mining project?
* How do you find and prepare a data set for a text mining project? 
* This session will consist of an overview of databases that allow for the creation of data sets for text mining. Those are [marked on our A-Z list with the filter Text Mining](https://guides.smu.edu/az.php?t=45104). Participants will make a dataset of interest to them in Constellate (which includes data from JSTOR) 
* The session will also go over what is required for the creation and prepping of a data set for text mining (topics include the data life cycle, tools, access, copyright and licensing issues). 
   * [JSTOR Constellate for TDM](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/introTDM/blob/main/sections/Constellate.md)
   * [HathiTrust Research Center for TDM](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/introTDM/blob/main/sections/HTRC.md)

Goals: 
* Understand the context for one text analysis tool provider (ex. HTRC or Constellate)

    * This is the **second session** in a sequence of scaffolded workshops that are meant to culminate in you being able to completing a text mining project. What kinds of datasets are useful for Text Mining?

# Session 3: Introduction to Python for Text and Data Mining (TDM)

## What goes into learning how to use Python for a text mining project?
* How do you use coding (Python) for a text mining project? This session will consist of an introduction to Python for text mining. In this session we will focus on introducing Python basics and the use of Python notebooks, as well as an introduction to high performance computing (HPC) 

Goals:

* Introduce our hands-on example and case study
* Recognize research questions text analysis can answer

   * This is the **third session** in a sequence of scaffolded workshops that are meant to culminate in you being able to completing a text mining project. 
   * For this session if you want to run the cells in the [python notbook](https://github.com/SouthernMethodistUniversity/introTDM/blob/main/sections/TDM_Python.ipynb), you'll either need to request an M2 account [(details here)](https://www.smu.edu/provost/crc#accounts), or have [python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and a [jupyter notebook environment installed locally.](https://jupyter.org/install)
